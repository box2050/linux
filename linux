(a) Configure Apache web server
(b) Write a script ,monitor activity on Apache web server script should also start the Apache web server if it is not running.
 

(a)
rpm -qa | grep http
chkconfig httpd on
cd /
mkdir var/www/html
cd var/www/html
gedit sample.html

Now write something to the sample files. for example is given in...

<html>
<head>
<title> Hello </title>
</head>
<body>
This is apache web server practical
</body>
</html>
  
after that we need to restart httpd service for following command---

service httpd restart

after that we go to application >> internet >> conqueror to open a browser give the right path of the file where we written some html file code....   (((((this method not seen in the output file)))))

(b)


gedit test.sh

#!/bin/bash
c=0
while ps aux | grep http | grep -v grep >/dev/null
do
c=$((c+1))
sleep 1
echo c is $c
done
service httpd start


save button to save
chmod 777 test.sh
sh test.sh

minimize that terminal and open  a new terminal and stop the service

Aim: Write a simple script that ask the user to enter the name of the RPM or File that user
